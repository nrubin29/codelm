              CodeLM is a programming competition founded at Lower Merion High
              School in 2015. Competitors solve a variety of algorithm
              challenges to rack up points and win prizes.

            <p class="content">
              While CodeLM is usually a team-based event, we will most likely
              have all competitors compete alone in their own homes this year to
              promote social distancing.

            <p class="content">
              This year's competition will be online. The opening and closing
              presentations will be delivered over Zoom, and competitors will
              solve problems in their own homes to promote social distancing.
              More information will be announced closer to the event.

            <h3 class="title">How can I practice for the competition?</h3>
            <p class="content">
              You can register a practice account and get access to last year's
              problems. This will let you practice with the CodeLM dashboard and
              the types of problems you'll see in the real event. To register a
              practice account, click the Register button on the login page,
              choose a username and password, enter your name as you registered
              for the event, and click the Register button. Once you're in the
              dashboard, click the Download Starter Code button to get the
              starter code. Then, use the starter code for your preferred
              language to solve the problems!

              How similar are the practice problems to the real problems?
            </h3>
            <p class="content">
              The practice problems are the exact problems used in last year's
              competition, so you can expect a similar format and level of
              difficulty in this year's problem set.
