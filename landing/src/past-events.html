          The first iteration of CodeLM was really more of an experiment. It
          took place on Thursday, May 28<sup>th</sup> in the Lower Merion High
          School library and was only open to LMHS students. Based on the
          success of the event and the positive feedback, we decided to hold
          CodeLM again in 2016.

          Our second event took place on February 9<sup>th</sup> and grew in
          many ways. We opened CodeLM up to other schools in the area and 10
          schools signed up. We also gained a corporate sponsor, Susquehanna
          International Group, who sent some developers to help with the event.
          Finally, we introduced an open-ended problem that was hand-graded by
          the SIG developers. Competitors were tasked with implementing a
          modified version of Blackjack that we invented called Diecisiete.

          Our fourth event took place on April 17<sup>th</sup>. We moved from
          the Lower Merion High School library to SIG's headquarters in Bala
          Cynwyd.

          Our fifth event (and first major milestone) took place on March
          29<sup>th</sup>. We had so many competitors that we had to spread out
          across two floors of the SIG building!

          Our sixth event took place on April 17<sup>th</sup>. Due to the
          coronavirus pandemic, we were forced to move the event online, but
          this didn't come without benefits. Because competitors didn't have to
          show up in person, we were able to open up the event to students all
          across the country. Over 200 students from 14 states competed - far
          more than any previous year.

          likely be online again. Check back soon for more details!
